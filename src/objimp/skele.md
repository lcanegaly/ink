- Read in file from system. 
- Create a vertex vector
- Load any line starting with letter v as a vertex point.
- Expect 3 doubles seperated by spaces per vertex point.
- Create a face vector
- Load any line starting with f as a face.
- Faces for now will be triangles
- Faces will be in vertex_index/texture_index/normal_index form with spaces
